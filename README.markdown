# Quake 3 + Mods Configuration

This is my quake 3 + mods (CPMA, Freeze, Defrag, etc...) configuration system. Some commands may be out of date, I have archived these files in the hope that I will still need this configuration one day. 

## Features

* per game mode / mod binds and settings
* the ability to select game mode at startup or change on the fly
* a rebind system allowing easy rebinding of specific keys: `q`, `f` and `MOUSE2`
* easy chat mode switch (All to Team)
* switching scripts
   * volume
   * gamma
   * timenudge
   * auto switch
   * blood
   * fastsky
   * simple items
* and a lovely timebomb script

Note: All of these features have not been tested in some time.


*Play more promode*
